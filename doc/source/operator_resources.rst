Custom Resources
================
.. currentmodule:: dask_kubernetes.experimental

.. warning::
    The Dask Operator for Kubernetes is experimental. So any `bug reports <https://github.com/dask/dask-kubernetes/issues>`_ are appreciated!

The Dask Operator has a few custom resources that can be used to create various Dask components.

- `DaskCluster`_ creates a full Dask cluster with a scheduler and workers.
- `DaskWorkerGroup`_ creates homogenous groups of workers, ``DaskCluster`` creates one by default but you can add more if you want multiple worker types.
- `DaskJob`_ creates a ``Pod`` that will run a script to completion along with a ``DaskCluster`` that the script can leverage.

DaskCluster
-----------

The ``DaskCluster`` custom resource creates a Dask cluster by creating a scheduler ``Pod``, scheduler ``Service`` and default `DaskWorkerGroup`_ which in turn creates worker ``Pod`` resources.

Let's create an example called ``cluster.yaml`` with the following configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # cluster.yaml
    apiVersion: kubernetes.dask.org/v1
    kind: DaskCluster
    metadata:
      name: simple-cluster
    spec:
      worker:
        replicas: 2
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: worker
            image: "ghcr.io/dask/dask:latest"
            imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
            args:
              - dask-worker
              - --name
              - $(DASK_WORKER_NAME)
      scheduler:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: scheduler
            image: "ghcr.io/dask/dask:latest"
            imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
            args:
              - dask-scheduler
            ports:
              - name: comm
                containerPort: 8786
                protocol: TCP
              - name: dashboard
                containerPort: 8787
                protocol: TCP
            readinessProbe:
              tcpSocket:
                port: comm
                initialDelaySeconds: 5
                periodSeconds: 10
            livenessProbe:
              tcpSocket:
                port: comm
                initialDelaySeconds: 15
                periodSeconds: 20
        service:
          type: NodePort
          selector:
            dask.org/cluster-name: simple-cluster
            dask.org/component: scheduler
          ports:
          - name: comm
            protocol: TCP
            port: 8786
            targetPort: "comm"
          - name: dashboard
            protocol: TCP
            port: 8787
            targetPort: "dashboard"

Editing this file will change the default configuration of you Dask cluster. See the Configuration Reference :ref:`config`. Now apply ``cluster.yaml``

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl apply -f cluster.yaml
   daskcluster.kubernetes.dask.org/simple-cluster created

We can list our clusters:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl get daskclusters
   NAME             AGE
   simple-cluster   47s

To connect to this Dask cluster we can use the service that was created for us.

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl get svc -l dask.org/cluster-name=simple-cluster
   NAME                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
   simple-cluster-service   ClusterIP   10.96.85.120   <none>        8786/TCP,8787/TCP   86s

We can see here that port ``8786`` has been exposed for the Dask communication along with ``8787`` for the Dashboard.

How you access these service endpoints will `vary depending on your Kubernetes cluster configuration <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/access-cluster-services/>`_.
For this quick example we could use ``kubectl`` to port forward the service to your local machine.

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl port-forward svc/simple-cluster-service 8786:8786
   Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8786 -> 8786
   Forwarding from [::1]:8786 -> 8786

Then we can connect to it from a Python session.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from dask.distributed import Client
   >>> client = Client("localhost:8786")
   >>> print(client)
   <Client: 'tcp://10.244.0.12:8786' processes=3 threads=12, memory=23.33 GiB>

We can also list all of the pods created by the operator to run our cluster.

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl get po -l dask.org/cluster-name=simple-cluster
   NAME                                                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   simple-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-13f4f0d13bbc40a58cfb81eb374f26c3   1/1     Running   0          104s
   simple-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-aa79dfae83264321a79f1f0ffe91f700   1/1     Running   0          104s
   simple-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-f13c4f2103e14c2d86c1b272cd138fe6   1/1     Running   0          104s
   simple-cluster-scheduler                                                      1/1     Running   0          104s

The workers we see here are created by our clusters default ``workergroup`` resource that was also created by the operator.

You can scale the ``workergroup`` like you would a ``Deployment`` or ``ReplicaSet``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl scale --replicas=5 daskworkergroup simple-cluster-default-worker-group
   daskworkergroup.kubernetes.dask.org/simple-cluster-default-worker-group scaled

We can verify that new pods have been created.

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl get po -l dask.org/cluster-name=simple-cluster
   NAME                                                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   simple-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-13f4f0d13bbc40a58cfb81eb374f26c3   1/1     Running   0          5m26s
   simple-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-a52bf313590f432d9dc7395875583b52   1/1     Running   0          27s
   simple-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-aa79dfae83264321a79f1f0ffe91f700   1/1     Running   0          5m26s
   simple-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-f13c4f2103e14c2d86c1b272cd138fe6   1/1     Running   0          5m26s
   simple-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-f4223a45b49d49288195c540c32f0fc0   1/1     Running   0          27s
   simple-cluster-scheduler                                                      1/1     Running   0          5m26s

Finally we can delete the cluster either by deleting the manifest we applied before, or directly by name:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl delete -f cluster.yaml
   daskcluster.kubernetes.dask.org "simple-cluster" deleted

   $ kubectl delete daskcluster simple-cluster
   daskcluster.kubernetes.dask.org "simple-cluster" deleted

DaskWorkerGroup
---------------

When we create a ``DaskCluster`` resource a default worker group is created for us. But we can add more by creating more manifests. This allows us to create workers of different shapes and sizes that `Dask can leverage for different tasks <https://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/resources.html>`_.

.. mermaid::

    graph TD

      class DefaultDaskWorkerPodEllipsis disabled

      class HighMemDaskWorkerGroup dask
      class HighMemDaskWorkerPodA dashed
      class HighMemDaskWorkerPodEllipsis dashed


Let's create an example called ``highmemworkers.yaml`` with the following configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # highmemworkers.yaml
    apiVersion: kubernetes.dask.org/v1
    kind: DaskWorkerGroup
    metadata:
      name: simple-cluster-highmem-worker-group
    spec:
      cluster: simple-cluster
      worker:
        replicas: 2
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: worker
            image: "ghcr.io/dask/dask:latest"
            imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
            resources:
              requests:
                memory: "2Gi"
              limits:
                memory: "32Gi"
            args:
              - dask-worker
              - --name
              - $(DASK_WORKER_NAME)

The main thing we need to ensure is that the ``cluster`` option matches the name of the cluster we created earlier. This will cause
the workers to join that cluster.

See the Configuration Reference :ref:`config`. Now apply ``highmemworkers.yaml``

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl apply -f highmemworkers.yaml
   daskworkergroup.kubernetes.dask.org/simple-cluster-highmem-worker-group created

We can list our clusters:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl get daskworkergroups
   NAME                                  AGE
   simple-cluster-default-worker-group   2 hours
   simple-cluster-highmem-worker-group   47s

We don't need to worry about deleting this worker group seperately, because it has joined the existing cluster Kubernetes will delete it
when the ``DaskCluster`` resource is deleted.

Scaling works the same was as the default worker group and can be done with the ``kubectl scale`` command.

DaskJob
-------

The ``DaskJob`` custom resource behaves similarly to other Kubernetes batch resources.
It creates a ``Pod`` that executes a command to completion. The difference is that the ``DaskJob`` also creates
a ``DaskCluster`` alongside it and injects the appropriate configuration into the job ``Pod`` for it to
automatically connect to and leverage the Dask cluster.

.. mermaid::

Let's create an example called ``job.yaml`` with the following configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # job.yaml
    apiVersion: kubernetes.dask.org/v1
    kind: DaskJob
    metadata:

              args:
                - python
                - -c
                - "from dask.distributed import Client; client = Client(); # Do some work..."

            service:
              type: ClusterIP
              selector:
                dask.org/cluster-name: simple-job-cluster
                dask.org/component: scheduler

                  port: 8787
                  targetPort: "dashboard"


Editing this file will change the default configuration of you Dask job. See the Configuration Reference :ref:`config`. Now apply ``job.yaml``

.. code-block:: console

    $ kubectl apply -f job.yaml
      daskjob.kubernetes.dask.org/simple-job created

Now if we check our cluster resources we should see our job and cluster pods being created.

.. code-block:: console

    $ kubectl get pods
    NAME                                                        READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    simple-job-cluster-scheduler                                1/1     Running             0          8s
    simple-job-runner                                           1/1     Running             0          8s
    simple-job-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-1f6c670fba   1/1     Running             0          8s
    simple-job-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-791f93d9ec   1/1     Running             0          8s

Our runner pod will be doing whatever we configured it to do. In our example you can see we just create a simple ``dask.distributed.Client`` object like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from dask.distributed import Client


    client = Client()

    # Do some work...


We can do this because the job pod gets some additional environment variables set at runtime which tell the ``Client`` how to connect to the cluster, so the user doesn't need to
worry about it.

The job pod has a default restart policy of ``OnFalure`` so if it exits with anything other than a ``0`` return code it will be restarted automatically until it completes successfully. When it does return a ``0`` it will
go into a ``Completed`` state and the Dask cluster will be cleaned up automatically freeing up Kubernetes cluster resources.

.. code-block:: console

    $ kubectl get pods
    NAME                                                        READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    simple-job-runner                                           0/1     Completed           0          14s
    simple-job-cluster-scheduler                                1/1     Terminating         0          14s
    simple-job-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-1f6c670fba   1/1     Terminating         0          14s
    simple-job-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-791f93d9ec   1/1     Terminating         0          14s

When you delete the ``DaskJob`` resource everything is delete automatically, whether that's just the ``Completed`` runner pod left over after a successful run or a full Dask cluster and runner that is still running.

.. code-block:: console

    $ kubectl delete -f job.yaml
    daskjob.kubernetes.dask.org "simple-job" deleted
