History
=======

This repository was originally inspired by a
`Dask+Kubernetes solution <https://github.com/met-office-lab/jade-dask/blob/master/kubernetes/adaptive.py>`__
within the
`Jade (Jupyter and Dask Environemt) <http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/projects/jade.html>`__
project out of the
`UK Met office <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/>`__
`Informatics Lab <http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/>`__.
This Dask + Kubernetes solution was primarily developed by
`Jacob Tomlinson <https://github.com/jacobtomlinson>`__
of the Informatics Lab and
`Matt Pryor <https://github.com/mkjpryor-stfc>`__
of the `STFC <http://www.stfc.ac.uk/>`__
and funded by `NERC <http://www.nerc.ac.uk/>`__.

It was then adapted by `Yuvi Panda <http://words.yuvi.in/>`__ at the
`UC Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) <https://bids.berkeley.edu/>`__
and `DSEP <http://data.berkeley.edu/>`__ programs while using it with
`JupyterHub <https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ on the
`Pangeo project <https://pangeo-data.github.io/>`__.
It was then brought under the Dask github organization where it lives today.
